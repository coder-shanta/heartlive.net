                <p>1 USD=8,000 beans.</p>
                <h3>2. How do I buy beans?</h3>

                <p>
                  Beans are the virtual currency of the heartlive platform. They can be used to send gifts to heartlive talents, purchase VIP packages or any other service available on our platform.
                  Gems are received through gifting. Once you have enough gems, you can convert them back into beans.
                </p>
                <h3>4. I bought beans, but never received them!</h3>
                <p>
                  If you have purchased beans on heartlive but they have not showed up in your account, we are happy to help. Please provide us the receipt from PayPal, PayTM, Easypaisa, App Store,
                  Google Play store, as well as a screenshot of your profile page for us to track your order quickly.

                <h3>5. Why have some gift options disappeared from the Gift Shop?</h3>
                <p>
                  We have many gift ideas, but due to the limited availability of the gift shop slots, we may replace some gifts with new ones from time to time. Please try out the new ones that are
                  equally fun!.
                </p>

                <h3>6. What can I do with my Gems I earn while streaming?</h3>
                <p>
                  When another user sends you a gift, you will receive gems. These gems can be exchanged for virtual currency beans. Find the prompt for exchanging gems to beans on the “Me” page by
                  clicking the “Earnings” box.
                </p>
                <h3>7. As a user, can I convert the beans I have earned to real-life currency?</h3>
                <p>Sorry. We currently do not support this feature.</p>
                <h3>8. As a signed talent, when can I receive my gift revenue?</h3>
                <p>
                  Generally, at heartlive, we will pay gift revenue for a previous month within 5 working days of the beginning of the subsequent month.<br />
                  * However, if any of the various payment platforms supported by heartlive delay the funds for any reason, we will wait until those funds clear to complete the requested
                  transaction.<br />
                  *If a user seeks refund of funds spent through Apple Pay within the 3 month clearance period, the virtual currency amount corresponding to the requested refund amount will be frozen
                  and deducted from any talent that has received virtual currency gifts sent using the refunded funds. As deemed necessary, certain payment methods may be temporarily discontinued or
                  virtual bean distribution will be paid on a by-stage basis to protect against malicious refund requests.

                <p>Talent beans bag is same as user beans bag. Bag limit depends upon the quantity you have selected.</p>
                <h3>2. What does “Quantity” mean in the beans bag menu?</h3>
                <p>
                  Quantity refers to the number of beans bag that users will be able to grab. The total amount you wish to send will be divided randomly among the quantity of bags you send out. For
                  instance, if you send 10,000 beans with a quantity of 15 bags, that means your 10,000 beans will be divided among 15 bags and that 15 users each can get a portion of those 10,000
                  beans.

                    2.  The talent cannot be booted.<br>
                    3.  User must be in the showroom to use boot functions.<br>

                    5.  Talents, heartlive monitors and other official accounts can boot any user, regardless of their level or other credentials.<br>

                   6.  Users cannot be booted from official activity/customer support showrooms.<br>
                    7.  User Score: Users cannot boot other users that have reached a higher User Shield than they have.<br>

                  <h3>2. Explain Users Score?</h3>
                 <p>Users are given two sets of points for reaching high user levels, subscribing to VIP packages and other in-app achievements. One set is called User Score, the second set is called User Shield Score. If, in regards to two users, User Score <= User Shield Score, that means that the user with the lower User Score will be unable to boot the user with the higher User Shield Score.

                 <p>Tier 3 admin’s user score=80, that means they can boot Tier 2, Tier 1, VIP and Standard users.
Tier 1 admin’s user score=0, that means they cannot boot anyone. Note: This is different than in previous versions of heartlive.
